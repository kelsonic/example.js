// We have been using dot notation so far in the examples above, here is another example again:​
​var book = {title: "Ways to Go", pages: 280, bookMark1:"Page 20"};
​
​// To access the properties of the book object with dot notation, you do this:​
console.log ( book.title); // Ways to Go​
console.log ( book.pages); // 280
